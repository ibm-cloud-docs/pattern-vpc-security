# Overview
{: #overview}



This pattern is intended to:
* Accelerate and simplify solution design by providing a standard IBM Cloud deployment architecture reference following the IBM Architecture Framework.
* Provide a prescriptive, end-2-end enterprise-class solution design, with diagrams, component architecture decisions along with rationale for cloud component selection to meet enterprise requirements.
* Ensure requirements can be met from a performance, system availability and security perspective.





Following the Architecture Framework, the `<Pattern Name>` covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

- Compute: Virtual Servers
- Storage: Primary Storage, Backup Storage
- Networking: Enterprise Connectivity, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity, Load Balancing, DNS
- Security: Data Security, Identity and Access Management, Application Security, Infrastructure and Endpoint Security
- Resiliency: High Availability, Backup and Restore
- Service Management: Monitoring, Logging, Auditing, Alerting

The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of "aspects" and "domains", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. For more details, see [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework).
